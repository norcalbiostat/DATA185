# Overview

This lab serves to level the playing field when it comes to basic
computer literacy. For everyone to succeed, everyone must be presented
the same information. Not all students coming into this class have had
the opportunity to work with computers often, and even if you have, you
may not be uses to using computers in the way that we will be doing so
in this class.

Computers are not like phones, where apps 1-click install to a location
you don't need to care about, and "just work". To set yourself up for
success in school, research and professional life it is well worth your
time to take a moment and look at how to use a computer in a
professional setting.

## Instructions

This is a follow-along lab. The activities and questions that are asked
are designed to have you learn or practice something, without the
lecture part. This lets you more actively participate in your learning.
Some parts you are asked to do on your own, such as reading a short
article, or watching & listening to a short external video. Other times
you will be following along as the instructor demonstrates how to
accomplish a task.

Often you will be asked to Google something. This is not a cop-out on my
part as a way to not write instructions, learning how to effectively
search for information on the internet is one of the course objectives.
So we'll practice this activity often.

Green boxes like this indicates that this is a question for you to answer. Pay attention to where you should be answering these questions at. E.g. Canvas, Rstudio or somewhere else. This will be specified in the submission instructions section.

## Submission Instructions

Write your answers and submit your screenshots to the assignment "quiz" in Canvas.

# Computer Operating Systems

##### Review the Wikipedia entry on [Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

Specifically pay attention to 1) the image to the right, 2) the first
sentence and 3) the last sentence before the "Contents" block.

::: callout-tip
#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge

1.  In a sentence, in your own words, what is an OS, and list the four most commonly used OS's.
2.  What OS are you using? If the computer you are using to fill out this lab is different than the one you typically use, what is the OS you typically use? Is your lab neighbor using the same OS as you?
3.  Why do you think you need to know this information?

# File types

**File types** are also known as **file formats**, is the way computers
store (or **encode**) information.

**Filename extensions** are the little suffixes added to the **file
name** of a computer file. You may be familiar with extensions such as
`.docx`, `.html`or `.pdf` . These explicitly tell your computer what
program is used to open the file. The commonality these all have is that
they have a period `.` between the file name, and the file extension.

> Depending on your OS's settings, sometimes these file extension will
> not be shown in the file name.

However, your computer will also show a specific icon for file type.

::: callout-note
#### üëâ Do this

Google "File type icons", select "images".
:::

::: callout-tip
#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge

4.  Which file type icons do you recognize? Take a screen shot of a few
    and add them to your submission.
:::

‚ö†Ô∏èIf the file type extension gets removed from the file name, it can
potentially corrupt the file. Sometimes you can rename the file and put
the extension back on, sometimes this will not work.


# File organization

> File organization and naming are powerful weapons against chaos.\
> --Jenny Bryan

There are many ways to organize your files, you may find yourself
changing your organizational method part way through your academic
career. This is normal and expected. While you don't *need* to be
organized, your future self (and anyone you collaborate with) will find
it very helpful. Payoffs accumulate as your projects get more complex.

## File names

Review Jenny's slide deck.

**TLDR;**

`r emo::ji("sign")` myabstract.docx\
`r emo::ji("sign")` Joe's Filenames Use Spaces and Punctuation.xlsx\

**Three principles for file names**

1.  Machine readable
    -   avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity
2.  Human readable
    -   name contains information on content
3.  Plays well with default ordering
    -   put something numeric first, use proper dates, left pad numbers
        with zero

**Text**

You may be used to using **Sentence case** such as

> `Math 185 homework 1.docx`\
> `Donatello CV as of Feb 2021.pdf`

These are human readable because we can figure out what the file is
about based on the name. But they still violates principle #1 & 3.

Revised names:

> `hw01_math185_rdonatello.docx`\
> `2021-02_CV`

**Left pad numbers with zeros**

This means to use `01` instead of `1`.

if you don't left pad, you get this:

10_final-figs-for-publication.R\
1_data-cleaning.R\
2_fit-model.R

which is just sad

**Use `YYYY-MM-DD` for standard dates**

```{=html}
<img  src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png" width="50%" 
      alt="PSA on writing dates" 
      title = "PSA on writing dates"/>
```
```{=html}
<img  src="date-standards.png" width="50%" 
      alt="Noone uses MMDDYYYY" 
      title = "Noone uses MMDDYYYY"/>
```

## File locations

For the love of all that is holy, [DON'T SAVE FILES IN YOUR DOWNLOADS
FOLDER!]{style="color: red;"}

I had to get that out of my system.

A [file path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)) is like
directions for your computer on how to find your file.

:::{.callout-note}
#### üëâ Do this

Look at the examples of file paths on different systems in the linked Wikipedia article.

:::

-   A back slash `\` indicates a sub-folder.
-   Not all places that are easy to access using a mouse have a short path
    -   `C:\Users\rdonatello\Desktop\New folder`
-   Long paths don't always indicate lack of organization
    -   `C:\Users\rdonatello\Box\CHC All\01. Projects Active\SNAP-Ed on Campuses (SP6485201, 02)\08. Research and Evaluation\02. Data Analysis\shared reports`


:::{.callout-note}
#### üëâ Do this

Start to create good habits for yourself by saving files in an organized manner.

1.  Decide on a location for files associate with this class. This CANNOT be your downloads folder. 
2.  Create a class folder, and a `homework` subfolder
3.  Download [this file](../img/watch%20me.mp4) and save it in your `homework` subfolder. Give it a file name that meets the three principles listed above.

:::{.callout-tip}
#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge 

5. Submit a screenshot of your class folder with downloaded file.\
6. Write out the full path, including file name to the downloaded file.

# Install Programs

Data is often stored in a spreadsheet format (.csv, .xls, .xlsx) and so
you need a way on your local machine to open and view these files.
Google Sheets does not have the full functionality as a program like
Microsoft Excel. Mac Numbers also does not always play well with others.

Good news is that MS Excel (and the whole Office suite) is free for
students.

:::{.callout-note}
#### üëâ Do this

Follow (these instructions)[https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=8738] to install Excel on your computer.

If you do not have a Mac or Windows computer, come talk me about an alternative.

You will start learning Excel next week!
