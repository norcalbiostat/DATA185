For everyone to succeed, everyone must be presented\nthe same information. Not all students coming into this class have had\nthe opportunity to work with computers often, and even if you have, you\nmay not be uses to using computers in the way that we will be doing so\nin this class.\n\nComputers are not like phones, where apps 1-click install to a location\nyou don't need to care about, and \"just work\". To set yourself up for\nsuccess in school, research and professional life it is well worth your\ntime to take a moment and look at how to use a computer in a\nprofessional setting.\n\n## Instructions\n\nThis is a follow-along lab. The activities and questions that are asked\nare designed to have you learn or practice something, without the\nlecture part. This lets you more actively participate in your learning.\nSome parts you are asked to do on your own, such as reading a short\narticle, or watching & listening to a short external video. Other times\nyou will be following along as the instructor demonstrates how to\naccomplish a task.\n\nOften you will be asked to Google something. This is not a cop-out on my\npart as a way to not write instructions, learning how to effectively\nsearch for information on the internet is one of the course objectives.\nSo we'll practice this activity often.\n\n::: callout-note\n#### üëâ Do this \n\nGrey/Blue boxes like this are instructions for you to do something.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge\n\nGreen boxes like this indicates that this is a question for you to answer. Pay attention to where you should be answering these questions at. E.g. Canvas, Rstudio or somewhere else. This will be specified in the submission instructions section. \n:::\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nWrite your answers and submit your screenshots to the lab assignment \"quiz\" in Canvas. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Computer Operating Systems\n\n##### Review the Wikipedia entry on [Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)\n\nSpecifically pay attention to 1) the image to the right, 2) the first\nsentence and 3) the last sentence before the \"Contents\" block.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge\n\n1.  In a sentence, in your own words, what is an OS, and list the four most commonly used OS's.\n2.  What OS are you using? If the computer you are using to fill out this lab is different than the one you typically use, what is the OS you typically use? Is your lab neighbor using the same OS as you?\n3.  Why do you think you need to know this information?\n:::\n\n# Screen shots\n\nScreenshots are incredibly useful to convey a lot of information to another person, especially when you don't have the words to explain what you are seeing. There are two types of screenshots, one that takes an image of your entire window, and one that lets you outline an area and only \"snip\" that portion. \n\n> fill this in\n\n\n\n# File types\n\n**File types** are also known as **file formats**, is the way computers\nstore (or **encode**) information.\n\n**Filename extensions** are the little suffixes added to the **file\nname** of a computer file. You may be familiar with extensions such as\n`.docx`, `.html`or `.pdf` . These explicitly tell your computer what\nprogram is used to open the file. The commonality these all have is that\nthey have a period `.` between the file name, and the file extension.\n\n> Depending on your OS's settings, sometimes these file extension will\n> not be shown in the file name.\n\nHowever, your computer will also show a specific icon for file type.\n\n::: callout-note\n#### üëâ Do this\n\nGoogle \"File type icons\", select \"images\".\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge\n\n4.  Which file type icons do you recognize? Take a screen shot of a few\n    and add them to your submission.\n:::\n\n‚ö†Ô∏èIf the file type extension gets removed from the file name, it can\npotentially corrupt the file. Sometimes you can rename the file and put\nthe extension back on, sometimes this will not work.\n\n\n# File organization\n\n> File organization and naming are powerful weapons against chaos.\\\n> --Jenny Bryan\n\nThere are many ways to organize your files, you may find yourself\nchanging your organizational method part way through your academic\ncareer. This is normal and expected. While you don't *need* to be\norganized, your future self (and anyone you collaborate with) will find\nit very helpful. Payoffs accumulate as your projects get more complex.\n\n## File names\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### üëâ Do this\n\nReview Jenny's slide deck.\n:::\n\n\nContent in this section is credited to [Naming things](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) by Jenny Bryan.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nüõë myabstract.docx\\\nüõë Joe's Filenames Use Spaces and Punctuation.xlsx\\\nüõë figure 1.png\\\nüõë fig 2.png\\\nüõë JW7d\\^(2sl\\@deletethisandyourcareerisoverWx2\\*.txt\n‚úÖ 2014-06-08_abstract-for-sla.docx\\\n‚úÖjoes-filenames-are-getting-better.xlsx\\\n‚úÖfig01_scatterplot-talk-length-vs-interest.png\\\n‚úÖfig02_histogram-talk-attendance.png\\\n‚úÖ1986-01-28_raw-data-from-challenger-o-rings.txt\n\n**Three principles for file names**\n\n1.  Machine readable\n    -   avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity\n2.  Human readable\n    -   name contains information on content\n3.  Plays well with default ordering\n    -   put something numeric first, use proper dates, left pad numbers\n        with zero\n\n**Text**\n\nYou may be used to using **Sentence case** such as\n\n> `Math 185 homework 1.docx`\\\n> `Donatello CV as of Feb 2021.pdf`\n\nThese are human readable because we can figure out what the file is\nabout based on the name. But they still violates principle #1 & 3.\n\nRevised names:\n\n> `hw01_math185_rdonatello.docx`\\\n> `2021-02_CV`\n\n**Left pad numbers with zeros**\n\nThis means to use `01` instead of `1`.\n\nif you don't left pad, you get this:\n\n10_final-figs-for-publication.R\\\n1_data-cleaning.R\\\n2_fit-model.R\n\nwhich is just sad\n\n**Use `YYYY-MM-DD` for standard dates**\n\n\n```{=html}\n<img  src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png\" width=\"50%\" \n      alt=\"PSA on writing dates\" \n      title = \"PSA on writing dates\"/>\n```\n\n```{=html}\n<img  src=\"date-standards.png\" width=\"50%\" \n      alt=\"Noone uses MMDDYYYY\" \n      title = \"Noone uses MMDDYYYY\"/>\n```\n\n\n## File locations\n\nFor the love of all that is holy, [DON'T SAVE FILES IN YOUR DOWNLOADS\nFOLDER!]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\nI had to get that out of my system.\n\nA [file path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)) is like\ndirections for your computer on how to find your file.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### üëâ Do this\n\nLook at the examples of file paths on different systems in the linked Wikipedia article.\n\n:::\n\n-   A back slash `\\` indicates a sub-folder.\n-   Not all places that are easy to access using a mouse have a short path\n    -   `C:\\Users\\rdonatello\\Desktop\\New folder`\n-   Long paths don't always indicate lack of organization\n    -   `C:\\Users\\rdonatello\\Box\\CHC All\\01. Projects Active\\SNAP-Ed on Campuses (SP6485201, 02)\\08. Research and Evaluation\\02. Data Analysis\\shared reports`\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### üëâ Do this\n\nStart to create good habits for yourself by saving files in an organized manner.\n\n1.  Decide on a location for files associate with this class. This CANNOT be your downloads folder. \n2.  Create a class folder, and a `homework` subfolder\n3.  Download [this file](../img/watch%20me.mp4) and save it in your `homework` subfolder. Give it a file name that meets the three principles listed above. \n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge \n\n5. Submit a screenshot of your class folder with downloaded file.\\\n6. Write out the full path, including file name to the downloaded file.\n:::\n\n\n-   [How to find a path to a file in Windows\n    10](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32573080/how-can-i-get-the-path-to-a-file-in-windows-10)\n-   [How to find a path to a file on\n    Mac](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/252171/mac-finder-getting-the-path-of-a-directory-or-file-as-as-string)\n\n# Install Programs\n\nData is often stored in a spreadsheet format (.csv, .xls, .xlsx) and so\nyou need a way on your local machine to open and view these files.\nGoogle Sheets does not have the full functionality as a program like\nMicrosoft Excel. Mac Numbers also does not always play well with others.\n\nGood news is that MS Excel (and the whole Office suite) is free for\nstudents.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### üëâ Do this\n\nFollow [these instructions](https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=8738) to install Excel on your computer.  We will start learning Excel next week!\n\nIf you do not have a Mac or Windows computer where you can install your own programs, come talk me about an alternative.\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n#### ‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge \n\n7. Submit a screenshot showing the Excel program open on your computer. \n:::\n\n-----\n\nIf you have finished this lab early (and submitted to Canvas) then continue to use lab time to work on the rest of the activities for this module. \n\n",
