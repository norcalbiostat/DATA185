Not all students coming into this class have had the opportunity to work with computers often, and even if you have, you may not be uses to using computers in the way that we will be doing so in this class.\nComputers are not like phones, where apps 1-click install to a location you don‚Äôt need to care about, and ‚Äújust work‚Äù. To set yourself up for success in school, research and professional life it is well worth your time to take a moment and look at how to use a computer in a professional setting.\n\n\nThis is a follow-along lab. The activities and questions that are asked are designed to have you learn or practice something, without the lecture part. This lets you more actively participate in your learning. Some parts you are asked to do on your own, such as reading a short article, or watching & listening to a short external video. Other times you will be following along as the instructor demonstrates how to accomplish a task.\nOften you will be asked to Google something. This is not a cop-out on my part as a way to not write instructions, learning how to effectively search for information on the internet is one of the course objectives. So we‚Äôll practice this activity often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Do this\n\n\n\nGrey/Blue boxes like this are instructions for you to do something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge\n\n\n\nGreen boxes like this indicates that this is a question for you to answer.

    "text": "Upload vs Syncing in cloud storage\nSome cloud based storage systems are upload only, you upload a copy to their platform and there it lives until you remove it. Some platforms, like Box, Dropbox and Google Drive have a browser interface where you can view and sometimes edit your files.\nWhat is preferable for most students, faculty, professionals and researchers is to have a copy of all files both on your local computer, and the cloud. That way when a change is made to a file on one computer, it is automatically backed up to the cloud, and available on all other computers using the same program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAs an example, here is my setup: I have four devices I use regularly. 1) Work Windows PC, 2) Home Windows PC, 3) Work Mac laptop 4) Android Phone\nChico State wants employees to use Box for all of their work files. You can read more about cloud security on our campus here. I have installed Box Drive on both PC‚Äôs and my Mac laptop. I now have access to all my work files on 3 computers, and I can access/view these files through a browser from any device if needed, including my phone using the Box android app.\nBefore coming to Chico, I used Dropbox nearly extensively for my PhD research, it also holds nearly all my music and pictures of my animals (I pay an annual fee for the storage). I have Dropbox installed on my home PC and my phone app. If I need files from Dropbox while on a strange computer, I can log into my account via a web browser and access or download what I need.\nIn some classes students will submit their homework to a shared Google Drive. I also have Google Drive Stream installed on both my work PC and Mac, and the Android App. This lets me navigate on my computer to files in Google Drive, open and comment on their PDF homework submission files in a native program like Adobe Acrobat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Check your knowledge\n\n\n\nWhat cloud based storage system will you be using for this class? If you need help figuring this out, ask in Slack, come to community coding, or student hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nSign up for and install your cloud storage system of choice. Post a screenshot of your choice."
